    content: `Personal Finance is about responsibility towards financial resources or money. Anything you earn , spend, and save effectively contributes to your overall understanding of financial management. 

    This concept may seem straightforward to many individuals, and hopefully it is for you too. Unfortunately, the lack of a proper understanding about your financial situation and the ways for you to manage your resources effectively may lead to overspending, and subsequently result in debt.
    
    Of course, life is about living and sometimes that includes spending a little more on yourself and your relatives. However, it is important to keep in mind your long-term goals, and not substitute them for short-term happiness. Keep in mind that almost every decision you make in a day has an impact income, expenses, savings, investment, and asset protection.
