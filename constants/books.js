    content: `Personal Finance is about responsibility towards financial resources or money. Anything you earn , spend, and save effectively contributes to your overall understanding of financial management. 

    This concept may seem straightforward to many individuals, and hopefully it is for you too. Unfortunately, the lack of a proper understanding about your financial situation and the ways for you to manage your resources effectively may lead to overspending, and subsequently result in debt.
    
    Of course, life is about living and sometimes that includes spending a little more on yourself and your relatives. However, it is important to keep in mind your long-term goals, and not substitute them for short-term happiness. Keep in mind that almost every decision you make in a day has an impact income, expenses, savings, investment, and asset protection.

    content: `Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!
    -Robert T. Kiyosaki
    
    It's been nearly 25 years since Robert Kiyosaki’s Rich Dad Poor Dad first made waves in the Personal Finance arena.
    It has since become the #1 Personal Finance book of all time... translated into dozens of languages and sold around the world.
    
    Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's story of growing up with two dads  his real father and the father of his best friend, his rich dad  and the ways in which both men shaped his thoughts about money and investing. The book explodes the myth that you need to earn a high income to be rich and explains the difference between working for money and having your money work for you.
    
    In many ways, the messages of Rich Dad Poor Dad, messages that were criticized and challenged two decades ago, are more meaningful, relevant and important today than they were 20 years ago.
    
    As always, readers can expect that Robert will be candid, insightful... and continue to rock more than a few boats in his retrospective.
    
    Will there be a few surprises? Count on it.
